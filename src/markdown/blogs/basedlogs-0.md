I'm really interested in the field of graphics programming and I want to become a graphics programmer. I've made previous attempts at learning working on projects such as [Vulkan Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/vulkan-model-viewer), [WebGL2 Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/WebGL2-Model-Viewer), [OpenGL Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/opengl-model-viewer), and [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer). These projects started towards the end of my university degree up until early 2024. The first mistake I made was starting with [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)... it is notoriously difficult and I basically just followed a video tutorial without learning much. The next few mini projects were all within some derivative of OpenGL which is considered to be the friendliest graphics API to jump into. I made some progress with each building upon some basic ideas. My latest attempt [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) was making some progress but I took a detour to win [Â£10,000 in a game jam](https://matek.dev/blog/facepunch-gamejam/). Not to mention I made a conscious decision to avoid using ECS which ruined my code quality when attempting to implement multiple lighting types.

So what did I realize with all of this trial and error? [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) is a crazy good resource and I plan to go through the major sections and implement them. This is basically what I was doing with the [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) project. My next attempt at learning graphics programming will be developing the [Based Engine](https://github.com/matekdev/based-engine). The biggest difference is I'll be using [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) so I can easily implement and separate new features such as lighting types.

I'm going to be writing blogs about features I find interested and concepts I want to commit to memory. A lot of times I will be repeating exactly what I learned within [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) but in a form where I can understand it. The first goal of the project will be to cover and implement every single important concept taught in [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). I think afterwards rewriting the project using a modern graphics API makes sense.
