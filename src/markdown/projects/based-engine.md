Based on what? Based Engine is a 3D OpenGL "engine" written in modern C++. The goal is to create a 3D playground that allows users to easily interact and implement various graphics features. My previous project [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) was written with the same intention... however adding new functionality without ECS proved to be cumbersome.

The initial plan for this project is to go through [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and implement various graphics features. For instance, the engine already supports multiple [light types such as directional lights, point lights, and spot lights](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-5/). After I run out of functionality to implement I plan to reimplement all the same features in a modern graphics API.

I have written many [blog posts](https://matek.dev/blog/) describing my learning process and implementation details of various features for this engine. The first post for instance goes into the details of [object picking](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-1/).
