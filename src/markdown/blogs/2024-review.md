I wrote a [blog post at the end of 2023](https://matek.dev/blog/one-blog/). So why not continue the tradition? A major complaint I made last year was that I didn't really write any blogs. Well, this time around, I wrote over 25!

## 2023 Goals

I mentioned in 2023 that I wanted to get back to doing interviews... well. I didn't do any at all. It just doesn't really align with any personal goals. It was really awesome getting to chat with the people I interviewed. A big thanks to Élisée Maurer, Minh Le, and Phil Gurski.

## Second Full-Time Job

I ended up quitting my job at [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) because I wanted to move back to Vancouver. I was spending a huge part of my income on my apartment, only to mostly work remotely from said apartment. Not to mention, it was draining having to fly back and forth to visit family. I asked for the ability to work remotely from Vancouver; however, due to bureaucratic reasons, that was not possible.

## Job Search

I interviewed at various companies and ended up with a role at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/ca-en). I'm extremely excited about the role, as the company looks amazing to work for, and the project and tech stack are exactly what I was looking for. Not much to say until I finally start.

## Gamedev

This year I worked with [Small Fish](https://smallfi.sh/) and we collectively won over **$26,000 USD** in prize money. The games we produced for the s&box jam were incredible and we really have the ability to create some amazing experiences.

The biggest issue that has been holding us back is s&box. The engine is in constant development, which means that there are constant changes that break our games. I have a feeling this is going to be a constant pain point for the next year or two. There isn't much we can do. The engine needs developing and I don't think Facepunch are interested in providing version locks.

I've been working on porting one of our games to Unity as a proof of concept. I would love to continue working within s&box, but it's just not there yet. I'm still really excited to see how it develops in the future.

## Based Engine

I learned quite a lot developing my little hobby engine this year. For now, I'm going to take an indefinite break from it and continue with gamedev.

## 2025

I really want to put my head down and grind and flourish at my new role. During whatever free time, it would be really neat to release one of our games on Steam. The closest feeling I've had to that is seeing some of the games I worked on in the [s&box trailer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/590830/sbox/) on Steam.
