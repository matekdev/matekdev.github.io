Matt's Minigolf is the premier multiplayer minigolf experience available on previous versions of [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). I assisted [FacePunch](https://facepunch.com/) developers with rewriting the entire user interface in the new s&box UI system [Razor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-8.0). In addition to this, I contributed to codebase refactors, introduced new gameplay features, and addressed various bugs for an improved gameplay experience.
