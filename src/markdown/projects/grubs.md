Grubs is a procedurally generated multiplayer worms-like experience. You spawn in with multiple "grubs" in a randomly generated map and fight against other players. Our large collection of weapons create for hilarious moments as you blow up the map and other grubs until victory.

I was one of the main programmers on Grubs developing various gameplay systems and the entirety of the user interface. One of the most extensive systems being the weapon component system which allowed simple implementation of future weapon types. During the closed beta of the s&box game engine we accumulated a player count in the thousands. We even had [YouTubers with subscriber counts close to a million feature our game](https://youtu.be/flcAvTeu1sw).
