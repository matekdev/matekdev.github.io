"My Summer Cottage" is an entry for the [first Facepunch hosted s&box game jam](https://sbox.game/c/gamejam1/results). We placed 1st and won the grand price of **$13,000 USD**.

The gameplay is quite unique... you are dropped into an "interesting" Finnish world where you do tasks to satisfy your nagging wife. These usually involve hunting, fishing, and gambling while encountering random events throughout the day.

The areas I contributed were in systems programming, network programming, gameplay programming, UI programming, shaders, and sound design. I basically played a jack of all trades role and assisted across many different areas of the project.
