"Death Card" is an entry for the [second Facepunch hosted s&box game jam](https://sbox.game/c/gamejam2/results). This entry won **$13,000 USD** in prize money and placed 2nd out of 100+ entries.

The role I played was extremely [similar to the previous game jam](https://matek.dev/projects/my-summer-cottage/). I contributed to systems programming, network programming, gameplay programming, UI programming, and sound design. I basically played a generalist programming role lending support to areas that needed it.
