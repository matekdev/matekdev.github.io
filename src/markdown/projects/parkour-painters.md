Parkour Painters is a multiplayer parkour platformer where you battle against other gangs to graffiti the city around you. It won $1600 USD in prize money as apart of a s&box game jam.

I developed the entire parkour movement system which included complex movements such as wall jumping, ledge grabbing, and grinding. As well as general gameplay systems and the design of the entire user interface. I even dabbled into music composition and created one of the music tracks used for the game.
