Lean Engine is a 3D OpenGL "engine" written in modern C++. The primary goal was to work through [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and implement various graphics features. I wrote over ~15 blogs covering various graphics topics and implementation details for the engine. A few example blogs include... [Shadow Mapping](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-14/), [RenderDoc](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-7/), and [Blinn-Phong lighting](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-13/).
