I setup some extremely basic support for messing around with physics objects. It uses the same BBox that I mentioned from the last blog. As soon as you attach a `RigidBody` component it converts the physics body from static to dynamic. Since I have object picking and gizmo support... you can drag around the objects and see the objects all interact in real time.

My overall experience with PhysX was extremely positive. It was easy to setup and to get integrated with my engine. The worst part was getting PhysX built and setting it up with my build system... but that is a pretty common issue with C++.

I'm done messing around with physics engines for now because I want to refocus on graphics and general game engine functionality. The ability to setup some movement controller or some ball game is now there if I ever need it.
