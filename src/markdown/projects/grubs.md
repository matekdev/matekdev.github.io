Grubs is a procedurally generated multiplayer worms-like experience. You spawn in with multiple "grubs" in a randomly generated map and fight against other players. Our large collection of weapons creates hilarious moments as you blow up the map and other grubs until victory.

I was one of the main programmers on Grubs, writing many aspects of the game (round system, weapon component system, etc.) and the entirety of the user interface. During the closed beta of the s&box game engine, we accumulated a total player count in the thousands. We even had [YouTubers with subscriber counts close to a million feature our game](https://youtu.be/flcAvTeu1sw).
