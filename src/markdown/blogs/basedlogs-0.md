I'm really interested in the field of graphics programming and I want to become a graphics programmer. I've made previous attempts at learning graphics working on projects such as [Vulkan Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/vulkan-model-viewer), [WebGL2 Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/WebGL2-Model-Viewer), [OpenGL Model Viewer](https://github.com/matekdev/opengl-model-viewer), and [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer). These projects started towards the end of my university degree up until early 2024. The first mistake I made was starting with [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)... it is notoriously difficult and I basically just followed a video tutorial without learning much. I decided to swap to OpenGL derivatives and found myself making progress. My latest attempt [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) was going good until I took a detour to win [Â£10,000 in a game jam](https://matek.dev/blog/facepunch-gamejam/).

So what did I realize with all of this trial and error? [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) is a crazy good resource and I plan to go through the major sections and implement them. This is basically what I was doing with the [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) project. I'll be continuing my progress made in [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) in my new project [Lean Engine](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-engine). The biggest difference between the two is I'm going to design the latter around using [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt). I found that when working on [Lean Renderer](https://github.com/matekdev/lean-renderer) that implementing new graphics functionality such as different light types proved to be painful without ECS.

I'm going to be writing blogs about features I find interested and concepts I want to commit to memory. A lot of times I will be repeating exactly what I learned within [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) but in a form where I can understand it. The first goal of the project will be to cover and implement every single important concept taught in [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). I think afterwards rewriting the project using a modern graphics API makes sense.
