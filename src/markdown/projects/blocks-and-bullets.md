Blocks & Bullets is a voxel-based FPS where players build, destroy, and fight in fully destructible environments. The game includes multiple maps and game modes, including Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Infection, etc.

The areas I contributed were in systems, network, gameplay, and UI programming.
