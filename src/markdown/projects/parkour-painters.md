Parkour Painters is a multiplayer parkour platformer where you battle against other gangs to graffiti the city around you. It won **$1600 USD** in prize money as part of an s&box game jam.

I developed the entire parkour movement system, which included complex movements such as wall jumping, ledge grabbing, and grinding. Additionally, I worked on general gameplay systems and designed the entire user interface. I even dabbled in music composition and created one of the music tracks used in the game.
