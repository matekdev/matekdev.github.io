"My Summer Cottage" is an entry for the [first Facepunch hosted s&box game jam](https://sbox.game/c/gamejam1/results). We placed 1st and won the grand price of **Â£10,000**.

The areas I contributed were in systems programming, gameplay programming, UI programming, shaders, and sound design. I basically played a jack of all trades role and assisted across many different areas of the project.
