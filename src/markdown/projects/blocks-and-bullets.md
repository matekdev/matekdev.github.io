Blocks & Bullets is a voxel-based FPS where players build, destroy, and fight in fully destructible environments. The game includes multiple maps and game modes, including Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Infection, etc. It consistently ranks as the top game on the s&box platform.

I contributed to a wide range of areas in this project as a programmer, primarily in systems, networking, gameplay, and UI programming.
