TTT is a recreation of the classic experience found in [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). It was my first dive into working on a large scale multiplayer game in the s&box engine. It accumulated a total player count in the thousands and the publicly available source code enabled spin-offs copies to be created.

The development process was documented on my YouTube channel and the totality of the devblogs accumulated tens of thousands of video views and interactions from players. Ultimately, due to s&box being a work in progress game engine, development was ceased due to constant breaking changes.
