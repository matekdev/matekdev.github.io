Based on what? Based Engine is a 3D DirectX 11 "engine" written in modern C++. The primary focus is to implement various graphics features and general game engine functionality.

This project serves as a continuation of [Lean Engine](https://matek.dev/projects/lean-engine/) but instead of OpenGL it uses DirectX 11. A lot of the previous engine features will be ported to this project. There will be new graphics and engine functionality as well. For instance, I recently integrated [PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX) to serve as the underlying physics engine.
