I have a blog for some reason, and I don't really write things here. I should probably do it more often since it could be interesting to look back at some of the things I was up to when I was younger. This year has been pretty big for me developmentally wise. Both in my personal life and in software development.

<Heading title="Developing Games" />

I worked on some proper full-scale multiplayer games with a few people in the [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news) community. Mainly, [Grubs](https://matek.dev/projects/grubs/) and [Parkour Painters](https://matek.dev/projects/parkour-painters/). I wrote large portions of those projects, and they really do feel like games that could exist on Steam standalone. At some point, once I get some interesting idea I'm passionate about, I'm going to release a game on Steam.

<Heading title="Graduating University" />

I wrote a post about this but I [graduated university this year](http://matek.dev/blog/graduating-university/). I only have extremely positive things to say, so you could go read more about it over on that post. I still consider it to be one of my best decisions in life, and it gave me the skillset to become a competent developer (at least I think so).

<Heading title="First Full-Time Job" />

I've worked plenty of jobs during university and I honestly considered them to be regular work. A lot of the times I would ramp up extremely quickly and be treated as a regular employee instead of an intern. Well, I got my first job out of university as a back-end developer at [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/). It doesn't really feel any different from my internships other than I'm not employed for a fixed duration. The only other weird aspect is I could get fired and fail to make payments for my expensive Toronto apartment.

<Heading title="Moving Across Canada" />

I moved across Canada from Vancouver to Toronto due to my job. It's pretty interesting getting to live and experience a part of Canada I never visited before. I don't have any thoughts other than I prefer it to living in Downtown Vancouver.

<Heading title="2024" />

One thing I want to do in 2024 is get back to doing my interviews. There is a surprising number of really amazing people that are willing to chat. It doesn't even take up very much time either other than researching questions for the interview.

I just checked the date on my last interview, and it's [February 2021...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KOm3jJEXy4) maybe I'll actually do some in 2024...
