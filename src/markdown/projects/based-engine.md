Based on what? Based Engine is a 3D "engine" written in modern C++. The goal is to create a playground that allows me to easily interact and implement various graphics features.

This project originally started with OpenGL as it is one of the easiest graphics APIs to get started with. I wrote over ~15 blogs covering various graphics topics and implementation details for the engine. A few example blogs include... [Shadow Mapping](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-14/), [RenderDoc](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-7/), and [Blinn-Phong lighting](https://matek.dev/blog/basedlogs-13/). After feeling comfortable with OpenGL I decided to make the transition to DirectX 11.

I'm slowly working through implementing all previous features in the DirectX 11 version of my engine. I plan to extend this version of this engine further and implement even more complex graphics functionality. Once I feel that I have accomplished this, I plan to use [D3D11On12](https://github.com/microsoft/D3D11On12) to transition my engine to DirectX 12.
