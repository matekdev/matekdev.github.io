One of my areas of interest is computer graphics, so I've been introducing myself to various graphics APIs. What better way than to develop a basic model viewer in OpenGL? Here is a basic model viewer I wrote that uses [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for the user interface. I've noticed many developers the library, and I now understand why. Building a user interface in C++ hasn't been this seamless in a long time.

I also created a very similar application initially in WebGL2. At this point, I feel prepared to tackle a more complex application, possibly using a more modern graphics API. [The source code for this project is available here](https://github.com/matekdev/WebGL2-Model-Viewer).
