Shoot and Build is a multiplayer FPS game with a completely destroyable voxel world. Players can build and destroy the world around them as they shoot each other across various different maps and game modes. I assisted in various different areas such as the game loop, procedural viewmodel animations, networking, UI, sounds, etc.
