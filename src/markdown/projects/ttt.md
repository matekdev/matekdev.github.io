TTT is a recreation of the classic experience found in [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). It was my first dive into working on a large-scale multiplayer game in the s&box engine. I led the development of this project and received assistance from one other programmer and community contributors. It accumulated a total player count in the thousands, and the publicly available source code enabled spin-off copies to be created.

The development process was documented on my YouTube channel, and the totality of the devblogs accumulated tens of thousands of video views and interactions from players. Ultimately, due to s&box being a work-in-progress game engine, development was ceased due to constant changes to the engine that would break the game.
